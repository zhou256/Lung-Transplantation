# Lung transplantation
***Functions*** : Lung is the most important organ in the human respiratory system, whose normal functions are quite essential for human beings. Under certain pathological conditions, the normal lung functions could no longer be maintained in patients, and lung transplantation is generally applied to ease patients’ breathing and prolong their lives. However, several risk factors exist during and after lung transplantation, including bleeding, infection, and transplant rejections. In particular, transplant rejections are difficult to predict or prevent, leading to most dangerous complications and severe status in patients undergoing lung transplantation. Given that most common monitoring and validation methods for lung transplantation rejections may take quite a long time and have low reproducibility, new technologies and methods are required to improve the efficacy and accuracy of rejection monitoring after lung transplantation. However, one previous study did not provide a tool to predict the lung transplantation responses. Here, gene expression profiling data combined with clinical outcomes from public domain were used to establish an effective prediction model distinguishing patient into different clinical subgroups by using novel machine learning models. These models could screen effective genes with functional enrichments and create quantitative rules for distinction of patients with no rejection, rejection, late inflammation–atrophy changes, and recent injury. The tool and prediction could provide guidelines for clinical treatment of each rejection subtype and contribute to the revealing of complicated rejection mechanisms of lung transplantation.
